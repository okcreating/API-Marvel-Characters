The latest version of project merged to "develop" branch.
This app is getting list of Marvel characters from the server and represents them as tableview with searching option. Character's detailed view is available by click.

Things that had been done: data model, Tableview with custom cell + DetailView interface (UIKit), network processing using Alamofire, JSON decoding, network errors handling, API keys and other addition authentication parameters handling, working search functionality with alert in case of error.

To make loading data faster, number of characters limited to 20.
